	<p>I was born in 1978 at Tainan, a peaceful city in southern Taiwan. Since both my parents were teachers, they have very high expectation on me. Therefore I studied very hard in my childhood and teenage.</p>
	<p>Finally, I got admission from National Taiwan University, the best university in Taiwan. The electronic industry in Taiwan was promising at that time so I decided to major in Electrical Engineering.</p>
	<p>After I graduated, I worked as an IC designer in <a href="https://www.holtek.com" target="_blank">Holtek Semiconductor Inc.</a>. Later I became a field application engineer, at that position my social skill was improved through communication with customers. Gradually I found my passion in coding and I made up my mind to become a software engineer.</p>
	<p>Later I got admission from University of Southern California. I heard that the school is tough. Since my undergraduate major is Electrical Engineering, I was worried that I had no sufficient  knowledge about Computer Science. So I went to <a href="http://www.callutheran.edu" target="_blank">California Lutheran University</a> to study Computer Science first. Later I went to University of Southern California, where I really enjoy my study. At that time I am especially fond of gaming, computer graphics, and multimedia.</p>
