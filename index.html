    <h1>Welcome to my page!</h1>
    <p>Hi, my name is Wei-Ming Liu, you can just call me Ben. I am glad you are reading my page!</p>
    <p>I am a Software Engineer from Taiwan. I used to work as an IC designer. However after several years of work I found my passion in coding. In 2009, I decided to go to USC (University of Southern California) to study and got my M.S. degree in Computer Science. Then I worked as a software developer in U.S. for two years and eventually came back to Taiwan due to some family issue.</p> 
    <p>I have been working as a software engineer for several years in many different fields: iOS App, web server backend, embedded system, image recognition algorithm developer, and DevOps.</p>
    <p>I am a fast learner and very interested in learning new technology. Every time when I start working on a new field, I can always pick up required skills and language soon.</p>
